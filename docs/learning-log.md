# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Carson Woodruff  
**Date:** 10/22/25

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to start a GitHub repository from scratch
- How to format and document GIS repositories professionally

## Challenges and Solutions
Understanding how to run automation workflows that check code and file structure was a challenge I faced today. Interpreting the results of worflow jobs is something I had to pay close attention to.

## Connection to My GIS Career
My experience learning about GitHub repository management today will provide me with two major skills. The first relates to professional development, as I have learning how to set up GitHub in order to demonstrate my GIS work as a portfolio. The second skill is repository management as a collaborative tool, since repositories prove useful when working on projects with others.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
